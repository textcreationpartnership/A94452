         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Yet notwithſtanding your ſedulous vigilances hath wraſtled with thoſe extreme diſturbances, and diſtempers in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: We ſtill finde out many inconveniences ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing afreſh, to the great am<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>zement and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Majeſties loyall Subjects. Wherefore our humble motion is, that your Honours would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150326:3"/>revolve the ſtill growing miſeries, under which we have beene, and are now ſubjected: that you would be graciouſly pleaſed to adde a period to the calamities which are preſſed upon us. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſive current of theſe grievances diſtill from one originall ſpring, and that we conceive to be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant party, and faction, who build obſtructions againſt your deliberate and judicious determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; who caſt ſcandalous aſperſions upon what hath beene by you enacted; and labour to nullifie, or at leaſt to extenuate in a repugnant oppoſition, what you are in agitation to inſtitute. The boldneſſe of theſe malevolent adverſaries hath too audaciouſly outdared the very fundamentall lawes, and hath trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly ſtudied to ſubvert the foundation, upon which the Juſtice and Religion of this Nation is firmely built and eſtabliſht. We earneſtly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore entreat your Honours maturely to conſider their malicious intents, and daily practiſes againſt the State; which if they be not ſeaſonably caſtigated in time, before their infant conſpiracies grow to the prime height of their ripe perfection, they will then become incorrigible. Yet withall wee impartially acknowledge your ſedulity in correcting and ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring them, but your endeavours have ſtill beene fruſtrate and retarded, by reaſon of their abounding malignitie. And whereas divers high taxations have beene oftentimes impoſed on us, wee did alwayes upon the conſideration of the ſame, expect a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; but as yet wee have found little or no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe: the cauſe of which we neither conceive, or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150326:3"/>ſuſpect to be produced by you, but principally by the calumnious ſuggeſtions of that factious party; which we deſire may be excluded and expelled the Houſe of Peeres: Thus the liberty of the Subject is trampled downe, the Trades decay in the whole Kingdom, and for our parts, our Eſtates are ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably waſted by heavy impoſitions, that without your propitious relief we ſhall periſh with our Wives and Families; and Cattell which is the chiefeſt mine of our Countrey, have been bought, and driven from us by whole flockes and heards at once, ſome tranſported into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and others into moſt parts of <hi>England,</hi> ſo that unleſſe ſome ſuddain redreſſe be ſpeedily occaſioned by you, we ſhall be impoveriſhed: our ſerious motion is therefore, that your Honours would be pleaſed to vindicate the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive wrongs done unto our Countrey, and that you would ſpeedily eaſe us of this burden of miſery, which we are no longer able to ſupport. And whereas we eſpecially have alwayes ſhewn our loyalty to his Majeſty, our awfull obedience unto you, obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſubſcribing to what you have been pleaſed to impoſe upon us; yet notwithſtanding we are diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, and ſhamefully derided with ludibrious contempt more than any other Countrey what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; wherefore we beſeech you that the authours; ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or ſuggeſters of the ſame may be found out, and known, yea and ſuffer exemplary and condigne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for their reproaching us, according to their juſt demerits; for otherwiſe we can conceive this Epidemicall deriſion of us to be nothing elſe, but a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150326:4"/>ſcorning deteſtation to our known fidelity (which as we have hitherto kept, ſo ſhall ſtill continue invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable) this grievance eſpecially, unleſſe it be amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will become a great diſcouragement to all our Countreymen.</p>
            <p>We deſire likewiſe that Learning be not too much diſcountenanced and contemned, but rather that it may be advanced to its former dignity: for it is a moſt ignominious, ſhamefull, blaſphemous, and unknowne thing; yea, moſt incongruous both to the Word of God, and common reaſon too, that Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and Doctors of Divinity ſhould be equall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors. Thus if Scholarſhip be defaced, <hi>England</hi> (the glory of all Nations lately) is ſuddenly like to degenerate, and decline from its former ſplendor, and ſo conſequently become barbarous. Yet we ſpeak not this in behalfe of any, for we call God to witneſſe, and our own actions can teſtifie as much, that whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever your Honours ſhall finde culpable, and delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, we deſire may be proſecuted according to the due proceſſe of Law, and (if the atrocity of the crime require it) be fully executed according to the juſtice of the Realme. But amidſt all our own cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties eſpecially, we cannot omit that of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to hear of the condoleable miſery of the Proteſtant party, and the inhumane tyranny of thoſe helliſh Rebels: they have been in wofull diſtreſſe a long time, and yet almoſt deſtitute of relief, till of late your Honours have been moved to commiſerate their diſtreſſed eſtates; and as you have begun, ſo we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you proceed, and continue in the ſame progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150326:4"/>of mercy and charity; that the firſt beginning of Reſormation do not initiate in cruell oppoſition, and that the foundation whereon that Reformation ſhould be eſtabliſht, be not written with the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, and inſcription of blood. For our parts, we will to the uttermoſt of our powers labour to repell, and divert the furious rage of thoſe tyrants, and wil to the end of our lives ſtand in the defence, and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Proteſtant Religion. What we now crave more, is your mutuall concordance with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, that you may both concurre in a co-unite cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency of opinions, that the weighty affaires of the Kingdom may be deliberated with more facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that whatſoever you conſult of, may tend to the honour of God, the peace, ſafety, and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Land: that the malignant inſolency of the Recuſant party may be more eaſily curbed; that delinquents may be called to their trials, be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and ſuffer juſt execution: according as they have promerited, with expedition, leaſt they ſhould break out, and hatch new conſpiracies, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminate the more ſincere body: that the manifold abuſes to our Countrey be reſpectively vindicated; that the confuſions, diviſions, diſtractions, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances may be allayed in a peacefull mitigation; that the Divine Worſhip of God be no longer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned, but that it may rather be ſetled ſpeedily in a purer way; that a clearer way may be opened for Trading and Merchandiſe; that eſpecially this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duly conſidered, that we may be better fortified, and provided with Ammunition of Armes, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150326:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>other military Hoſtility, that ſo we may be more able to encounter with any forraigne Enemy, that ſhall preſume to oppoſe, or invade the Britiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; That thus being armed againſt any oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we may more freely enjoy the peace and liberty of our Conſciences, and eſtates; to the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his Majeſty, the immortall fame of your Honour, with the ſafety and proſperity of the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Thus your Petitioners ſhall be bound to pray for the happy ſucceſſe of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations, that the Divine Providence of Almighty God may direct and proſper all your deliberations, &amp;c.</p>
